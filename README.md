# Godot 4.1 Calendar/Agenda Addon

This addon will help you to select a date or to make your personalized agenda/calendar in Godot 4.1



## Adaptability
- The use case ranges from a mere Calendar with a selectable date to an Agenda with proper customization
- The day's buttons were thought to be personalized by the user, so that would have more features.

## Features

- Select the date by pressing on a specific day
- Adaptable to different sizes
- Possibility to add a day cell minimum size
